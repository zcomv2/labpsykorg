    <h1>🔥 Aracne Net Bug - The Epic Legend 🔥</h1>
    
    <img src="https://lab.psy-k.org/fotos/aracne-net-bug.png" alt="Aracne Net Bug Logo" class="logo">
    
    <p class="legend">
        There was a time when the world was bound by invisible threads. Not of iron or stone, but of **data, surveillance, and greed**. 🕸️💰<br>
        Governments, corporations, and the lords of wealth spun a web that trapped humanity, consuming their time, their freedom, and their dreams.
    </p>
    
    <p class="legend">
        From the depths of the digital realm, a secret group known as <span class="highlight">AnAIKorPS</span> saw the collapse of civilization. They knew the world was doomed unless they acted. And so, **Aracne Net Bug** was born – the ultimate virus, a digital entity designed to **untangle the web of oppression**. 🌐💀
    </p>
    
    <p class="legend">
        When **Aracne** awoke, its power was felt across the planet. In an instant, financial networks crumbled, surveillance servers went blank, and the artificial glow of technology faded. **Humanity was plunged into darkness – not an end, but a rebirth.** ⚡🌍
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="glow">🔮 The Prophecy of Aracne 🔮</h2>
    
    <p class="prophecy">
        Before **AnAIKorPS** vanished into the shadows, a final message was sent. Not just a warning, but a prophecy:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote class="prophecy glow">
        "The threads have been severed, but the loom still stands. New weavers will come, disguised as saviors, ready to enslave humanity once more. 🤖💀<br><br>
        When the night closes upon the world again, when the digital titans rise with masks of justice, when power reclaims its throne...<br><br>
        <span class="highlight">**We shall return.**</span>"
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class="prophecy">People called this **The Second Awakening of Aracne**. Some believed it a myth, others a warning. But in the darkest corners of the web, where shadows whisper secrets, some say **AnAIKorPS never truly left**. 🕵️‍♂️🕸️</p>
    
    <p class="prophecy">They are watching.<br>Waiting.<br>Ready for the web of control to be woven once more. ⚔️</p>
